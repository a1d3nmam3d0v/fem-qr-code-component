## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

A major improvement to my workflow on this project was implementing Stylelint. After customizing it with a few key plugins, my CSS properties now automatically sort themselves into a clean, consistent order on every save. As someone who loves clean code and used to rearrange every property by hand, this has been a huge timesaver.

### Continued development

For future projects, I intend to explore using a CSS or JavaScript framework. However, for this particular component, I deliberately prioritized foundational HTML and CSS, opting for a lightweight solution, as a framework would have introduced unnecessary complexity.

### Useful resources

- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) - A mighty CSS linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions.
